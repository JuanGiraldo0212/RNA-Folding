Tests to conduct:

 - Optimization of pseudoknot parameter
 - Length metric based on no. of hydrogen bonds instead of no. of base pairs (+ another optimization?)
 - Compare hybrid- versus fully-quantum solvers???

To-dos:

 - Get structures to compare against (http://bprna.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/advancedSearch.php, https://rfam.xfam.org/)
 - Optimize against constant pseudoknot parameter
 - Change "length" metric to represent number of hydrogen bonds instead of number of base pairs
 - Implement above
